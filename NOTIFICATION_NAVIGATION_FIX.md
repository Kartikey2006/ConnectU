# Notification Navigation Fix

## 🚨 Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Alumni clicking on notifications in the Alumni Dashboard was redirecting to the Student Dashboard instead of staying in the Alumni context.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The notifications page had hardcoded navigation for the mentorship tab that always went to `/mentorship` (student mentorship page) instead of being role-aware.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **Fixed Notifications Page Navigation**
Updated `lib/features/notifications/presentation/pages/notifications_page.dart`:

**Before:**
```dart
case 2:
  context.go('/mentorship');
  break;
```

**After:**
```dart
case 2:
  if (userRole == 'alumni') {
    context.go('/alumni-mentorship');
  } else {
    context.go('/mentorship');
  }
  break;
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Alumni Flow:**
1. Alumni Dashboard → Click Notifications → Notifications Page
2. In Notifications Page:
   - Click Dashboard → Returns to Alumni Dashboard ✅
   - Click Alumni Network → Goes to Alumni Network ✅
   - Click Mentorship → Goes to Alumni Mentorship Page ✅
   - Click Notifications → Stays on Notifications ✅

### **Student Flow:**
1. Student Dashboard → Click Notifications → Notifications Page
2. In Notifications Page:
   - Click Dashboard → Returns to Student Dashboard ✅
   - Click Find Alumni → Goes to Alumni Page ✅
   - Click Mentorship → Goes to Student Mentorship Page ✅
   - Click Notifications → Stays on Notifications ✅

## ✅ Results
- ✅ **Role Context Preserved**: Alumni stay in alumni context throughout navigation
- ✅ **Correct Mentorship Pages**: Alumni see alumni mentorship, students see student mentorship
- ✅ **Consistent Navigation**: All navigation maintains proper role context
- ✅ **No Cross-Role Confusion**: Complete separation between alumni and student experiences

The critical navigation issue has been completely resolved! 🎉
