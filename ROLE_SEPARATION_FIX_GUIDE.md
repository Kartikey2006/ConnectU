# Role Separation Fix Guide

## üö® Critical Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Alumni and students were sharing the same mentorship page and navigation, causing confusion and incorrect role context switching.

## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. **Shared Mentorship Page**
- Alumni and students were using the same mentorship page
- Alumni should manage their mentorship sessions
- Students should find and book mentors

### 2. **Navigation Context Loss**
- Alumni clicking notifications would sometimes switch to student context
- Back navigation wasn't role-aware
- Role context was not maintained across pages

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Created Separate Mentorship Pages**

#### **Alumni Mentorship Page** (`lib/features/mentorship/presentation/pages/alumni_mentorship_page.dart`)
**Features for Alumni:**
- **Upcoming Sessions**: View confirmed mentorship sessions with students
- **Recent Sessions**: Track completed sessions
- **Quick Actions**: Create sessions, view requests, analytics, settings
- **Session Management**: Reschedule, start sessions, manage student requests
- **Alumni-focused UI**: Professional interface for mentors

#### **Student Mentorship Page** (`lib/features/mentorship/presentation/pages/mentorship_page.dart`)
**Features for Students:**
- **Find a Mentor**: Search and connect with alumni mentors
- **Available Sessions**: Browse mentorship opportunities
- **Student-focused UI**: Learning-oriented interface

### 2. **Role-Aware Routing**

#### **Smart Mentorship Routing**
```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/mentorship',
  builder: (context, state) {
    // Check user role and show appropriate mentorship page
    final authBloc = context.read<auth_bloc.AuthBloc>();
    final authState = authBloc.state;
    
    if (authState is auth_bloc.Authenticated) {
      final userRole = authState.user.user.role.name;
      if (userRole == 'alumni') {
        return const AlumniMentorshipPage();
      }
    }
    
    // Default to student mentorship page
    return const MentorshipPage();
  },
),
```

#### **Dedicated Alumni Routes**
- `/alumni-mentorship` - Direct access to alumni mentorship page
- Alumni dashboard navigation uses `/alumni-mentorship`
- Student dashboard navigation uses `/mentorship`

### 3. **Fixed Navigation Context**

#### **Role-Aware Back Buttons**
All pages now have role-aware back navigation:
```dart
BlocBuilder<AuthBloc, AuthState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    String userRole = 'student'; // default
    if (state is Authenticated) {
      userRole = state.user.user.role.name;
    }
    
    return IconButton(
      onPressed: () {
        if (context.canPop()) {
          context.pop();
        } else {
          // Navigate to appropriate dashboard based on user role
          if (userRole == 'alumni') {
            context.go('/alumni-dashboard');
          } else {
            context.go('/student-dashboard');
          }
        }
      },
      icon: const Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
    );
  },
)
```

#### **Role-Aware Bottom Navigation**
- Alumni see "Alumni Network" tab
- Students see "Find Alumni" tab
- All navigation maintains role context
