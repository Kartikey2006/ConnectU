# Immediate Fix for Profile Completion Issue

## Problem
The app is still asking for profile completion after restart because the `is_profile_completed` column doesn't exist in the database yet.

## Two Solutions

### Solution 1: Quick Fix (Already Implemented)
I've added a temporary fix that uses local storage to track profile completion. This will work immediately without any database changes.

**What I did:**
- Added local storage tracking in the profile completion page
- Updated routing logic to check local storage as fallback
- This works even without the database column

### Solution 2: Database Migration (Recommended)
Run this SQL command in your Supabase database to add the missing column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_profile_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

## How to Run Database Migration

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run this command:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_profile_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
   ```
4. **Click "Run"**

## Testing the Fix

1. **Complete your alumni profile** (if you haven't already)
2. **Close and reopen the app**
3. **You should go directly to alumni dashboard** (not profile completion page)

## What Happens Now

- **First time completing profile**: Saves to both database and local storage
- **App restart**: Checks database first, then local storage as fallback
- **After database migration**: Uses database only (more reliable)

The temporary fix will work immediately, but running the database migration is recommended for a permanent solution.
