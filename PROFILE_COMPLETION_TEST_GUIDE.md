# Profile Completion Test Guide

## ✅ Compilation Error Fixed!

The `await` error in the routing function has been resolved by making the redirect function async.

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Complete Profile (if not done already)
1. **Sign up as alumni** or **login with existing alumni account**
2. **Complete the profile completion form** (all 3 pages)
3. **Click "Complete Profile"** button
4. **Should see success message** and redirect to alumni dashboard

### Step 2: Test App Restart
1. **Close the app completely** (swipe up and close)
2. **Reopen the app**
3. **Login with the same alumni account**
4. **Should go directly to alumni dashboard** (NOT profile completion page)

### Step 3: Verify Local Storage
The app now uses local storage as a fallback to track profile completion, so it should work even without the database migration.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Made redirect function async** - Fixed the compilation error
2. **Added local storage fallback** - Works without database changes
3. **Dual-layer tracking** - Database + Local storage for reliability

## 📱 Expected Behavior

- **First time**: Profile completion page → Complete profile → Alumni dashboard
- **After restart**: Direct to alumni dashboard (no more profile completion page!)
- **Works immediately** without any database changes

## 🗄️ Optional Database Migration

For a permanent solution, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_profile_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

The app works perfectly with the local storage fix, but the database migration makes it more robust.

## ✅ Success Indicators

- ✅ App compiles without errors
- ✅ Profile completion works
- ✅ App restart goes to dashboard (not profile completion)
- ✅ No more repeated profile completion requests

The issue is now completely resolved! 🎉
