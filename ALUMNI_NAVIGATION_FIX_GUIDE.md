# Alumni Navigation Fix Guide

## 🚨 Critical Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When alumni clicked on notifications in the Alumni Dashboard, they were being redirected to the Student Dashboard instead of staying in the Alumni Dashboard.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in multiple pages that had hardcoded navigation logic:

1. **Notifications Page**: Bottom navigation was hardcoded to redirect to `/student-dashboard`
2. **Mentorship Page**: Back button was hardcoded to redirect to `/student-dashboard`
3. **Alumni Page**: Back button was hardcoded to redirect to `/student-dashboard`

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Made Navigation Role-Aware
Updated all affected pages to detect user role and navigate accordingly:

- **Alumni users** → Navigate to `/alumni-dashboard`
- **Student users** → Navigate to `/student-dashboard`

### 2. Pages Fixed

#### **Notifications Page** (`lib/features/notifications/presentation/pages/notifications_page.dart`)
- Added `BlocBuilder<AuthBloc, AuthState>` to detect user role
- Updated bottom navigation to be role-aware
- Alumni see "Alumni Network" tab, Students see "Find Alumni" tab

#### **Mentorship Page** (`lib/features/mentorship/presentation/pages/mentorship_page.dart`)
- Added role detection to back button
- Alumni back button goes to `/alumni-dashboard`
- Student back button goes to `/student-dashboard`

#### **Alumni Page** (`lib/features/alumni/presentation/pages/alumni_page.dart`)
- Added role detection to back button
- Alumni back button goes to `/alumni-dashboard`
- Student back button goes to `/student-dashboard`

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Alumni Navigation:
1. **Login as alumni** → Should go to alumni dashboard
2. **Click notifications** → Should stay in alumni context
3. **Click back button** → Should return to alumni dashboard
4. **Navigate to mentorship** → Back button should go to alumni dashboard
5. **Navigate to alumni page** → Back button should go to alumni dashboard

### Test Student Navigation:
1. **Login as student** → Should go to student dashboard
2. **Click notifications** → Should stay in student context
3. **All navigation** → Should maintain student context

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Role Detection Pattern:
```dart
BlocBuilder<AuthBloc, AuthState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    String userRole = 'student'; // default
    if (state is Authenticated) {
      userRole = state.user.user.role.name;
    }
    
    // Use userRole to determine navigation
    if (userRole == 'alumni') {
      context.go('/alumni-dashboard');
    } else {
      context.go('/student-dashboard');
    }
  },
)
```

### Navigation Logic:
- **Alumni Dashboard** → All navigation maintains alumni context
- **Student Dashboard** → All navigation maintains student context
- **Role-aware back buttons** → Always return to correct dashboard
- **Role-aware bottom navigation** → Shows appropriate tabs for each role

## ✅ Results

- ✅ Alumni stay in alumni dashboard when clicking notifications
- ✅ Students stay in student dashboard when clicking notifications
- ✅ All back buttons work correctly for both roles
- ✅ Bottom navigation shows appropriate tabs for each role
- ✅ No more cross-role navigation issues
