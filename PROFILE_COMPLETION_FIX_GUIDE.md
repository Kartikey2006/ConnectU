# Profile Completion Fix Guide

## Problem Fixed
The alumni profile completion page was showing every time the app opened, even after completing the profile. This has been fixed to only show for new alumni accounts that haven't completed their profile yet.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model Updated
- Added `isProfileCompleted` field to track profile completion status
- Updated JSON serialization/deserialization
- Added to `copyWith` method

### 2. Routing Logic Fixed
- Updated `app_router.dart` to check `isProfileCompleted` status
- Alumni with completed profiles go to `/alumni-dashboard`
- Alumni with incomplete profiles go to `/alumni-profile-completion`

### 3. Profile Completion Handler
- Updated `_onProfileCompleted` in `AuthBloc` to mark profile as completed
- Updates the user record in database when profile is completed

### 4. Database Migration Required
Run the following SQL script in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Add is_profile_completed column to users table
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN is_profile_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Update existing users to have profile completed as false
UPDATE users 
SET is_profile_completed = FALSE 
WHERE is_profile_completed IS NULL;

-- Add an index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_profile_completed ON users(is_profile_completed);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **New Alumni Signup**: 
   - Creates account with `is_profile_completed = false`
   - Redirected to profile completion page
   - After completing profile, `is_profile_completed` is set to `true`

2. **Existing Alumni Login**:
   - If `is_profile_completed = true` → Goes to alumni dashboard
   - If `is_profile_completed = false` → Goes to profile completion page

3. **Profile Completion**:
   - Saves alumni profile details
   - Updates user record to mark profile as completed
   - Redirects to alumni dashboard

## Testing

1. **Test New Alumni Flow**:
   - Sign up as new alumni
   - Should see profile completion page
   - Complete profile
   - Should go to alumni dashboard
   - Close and reopen app
   - Should go directly to alumni dashboard (not profile completion)

2. **Test Existing Alumni**:
   - Login with existing alumni account
   - Should go directly to alumni dashboard (if profile completed)
   - Or to profile completion page (if profile not completed)

## Files Modified

- `lib/core/models/user.dart` - Added `isProfileCompleted` field
- `lib/core/routing/app_router.dart` - Updated routing logic
- `lib/features/auth/bloc/auth_bloc.dart` - Updated profile completion handler
- `Database/add_profile_completion_column.sql` - Database migration script

The fix ensures that alumni only see the profile completion page once, when they first sign up, and never again after completing their profile.
